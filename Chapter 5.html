<h3>■The Fairy Girl</h3>

<p>After hunting, me and Lidell started to go home as usual. While we're talking I remember the ghost I encounter in my inn.</p>

<p>“That girl was probably stray brownie.”</p>

<p>“Stray Brownie??”</p>

<p>“Brownie is like fairies, and they're rare see too. We call them stray brownie because they don't have master.”</p>

<p>In the world of novel, brownie's are fairies who do house chores and other stuff. But in this world, brownie's are actual fairies?</p>

<p>“Brownie's can't live long without masters. So there's probably something's happened to that brownie's master.”</p>

<p>“So there's no harm from it?”</p>

<p>“None. And if ever you see that brownie again, give her name. They are like blessing after all.”</p>

<p>That girl is cute that makes me want to protect her. Of course she's harmless.</p>

<p>“What will happen if I give her a name?”</p>

<p>“If you give a brownie a name, you'll become the next master, and she'll be live longer. Since they like living, that girl will likely accept it, but there are more fairy's who don't.”</p>

<p>Reminiscing what happened in that night. That girl was small like animal. Since she suddenly disappear, I thought she was ghost. Brownie's are spirit, there's nothing to be afraid of.</p>

<p>Now to think about it, ever since I came to this world, I've been discovering a lot of things that I wasn't aware of myself.</p>

<p>“She was cute and small like an small animal.”</p>

<p>“Cute like small animal huh? I can't imagine it and it's pretty different from what I've heard. ”</p>

<p>“I don't really know about fairies so I might be wrong too.”</p>

<p>She looks like a kid to me. As expected of fantasy.</p>

<p>“Brownie's are like humanoid plant. They're about 3 meters tall. But has a look like a child is something I've never heard of.”</p>

<p>“If that girl has big appearance I'll definitely get scared of her.”</p>

<p>In earth, the brownie I know was pretty different from this world's brownie. But as Lidell explain more about brownie's, they're actually pretty same.</p>

<p>“You can tell if they have growing leaves on their head.”</p>

<p>“Yup, there is.”</p>

<p>I thought that growing leaves in her head was her toy, but it might be trouble if I took that thing off.</p>

<p>“I'm not also familiar with the appearance but, that girl may be a brownie.”</p>

<p>“I see. If I see her tonight, I'll give her a name then.”</p>

<p>“Brownie tends to not know how to speak but they still have emotions. They're good observing surroundings and taking care of things, whether it is big or small. That's why most of the merchants became successful in their business when they own a brownie.”</p>

<p>“They may be good at hunting too.”</p>

<p>Making a game about guessing left or right maybe a good business, but I don't have funds yet, so it's impossible. But I'll still consider it.</p>

<p>“Business is all about trust, so finding partner is mostly on your own. Oh also, if the brownie's die, your things might also disappear so it's pretty risky. Adding the responsibilities in other parts, you may get involved in some troubles.”</p>

<p>Troubles huh.... Even though I'm in different world Louise and Lidell is also a person, not just by appearance but also they're existence. So, society must is also same.</p>

<p>I thought being a merchant is a good job but, I can't fight If I'm in close space where I can't move freely.</p>

<p>While feeling the gentle wind pass through my body and the smell of grass and flowers. Going home is actually my favorite. Even though I was raised in a stone jungle, Smelling the grassy wind doesn't feel hate to me.</p>

<p>Facing the east. I feel like I'm feeling the same wind as Lysette does.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Departing from Lidell, I go back to the town. When the sun is set, this is the time where this town is so lively, you can see a lot of people, you can also hear the conversations around you. It's like a festival.</p>

<p>After buying my midnight snack, a 2 loaf bread, I gone back to my inn and excitedly open the door.</p>

<p>Since the sun is already set, I light the candle and open my door of my room. As I excitedly light the room, the brownie's existence didn't appear throughout the room. I was little hopeful but maybe she's just hiding somewhere....</p>

<p>“Well, too bad....”</p>

<p>As I think of the future while sitting on bed. The 2 bread loaf suddenly move.</p>

<p>“Here she is...”</p>

<p>She literally targeted the food first.</p>

<p>As the brownie jump like the last time. Remembering the same pattern, I got back my bread.</p>

<p>“You want a bread?”</p>

<p>The brownie turn her face to me, she think about a second then nodded 2 times.</p>

<p>“Come here, I'll give you this bread.”</p>

<p>Patting my lap, the little girl was little hesitant but the power of bread empowered it and she eventually sat on my lap.</p>

<p>“I shall give you a name. From now on, your name is Momo.”</p>

<p>Since this girl has the same smell as peach, I'll call her Momo. (TL: Momo in English is peach.)</p>

<p>After I give her a name she was not happy but she became livelier than before and she give me a big smile. I guess she really like it.</p>

<p>“Here's more bread. Eat it as much as you want.”</p>

<p>Momo's cheeks was full of bread now while giving me her biggest smile.</p>

<p>Earlier, Lidell says brownie's are good at observing surrounding and taking care of things.</p>

<p>“Momo, can you fold this clothes for me.”</p>

<p>Then Momo look at my finger and she happily take care of the clothes. I thought she's gonna put it in the cabinet but it's not. A magic circle suddenly appeared in her hand and that magic circle suck my clothes and disappeared.</p>

<img src="">

<p>My clothes will come back..... right?</p>

<p>“Momo can you take out my clothes?”</p>

<p>This time, a magic circle appeared on the floor and my clothes suddenly pop out of it. Apparently it's still same as before. I wonder if there's other thing she can do?</p>

<p>“Momo, can you take my clothes again?”</p>

<p>After nodding. Momo open her hands and sucked my clothes again. She was like orchestra singer and it's kinda cute.</p>

<p>“This is gonna be useful. Thanks Momo. Here's more bread.”</p>

<p>As always Momo give me her best smile. I feel like I'm owning a pet right now. But since she also give me good vibes, everythings good.</p>

<p>After that, I wash her dirty clothes, take her to bath and wash her hair along the way.</p>

<p>As I wash my clothes too, I feel like I'm taking of my little sister that is same age as Momo. I feel relieved.</p>

<p>After drying my clothes, we came back to inn, the bed is big enough for both of us. Even though Momo is a spirit, she has still same warmth just like humans. Feeling the loneliness Momo's warmth helps me a lot.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>As I woke up. I thought I'm back on my old world, but reality is still reality. The main difference is there's small creature sleeping on my side of me. And that's Momo, sleeping happily.</p>

<p>Since there's no glass window here, a few pieces of wood is crafted as window. Since the light is not that strong, maybe it's just a light coming from outside, which pass through small holes of the window.</p>

<p>I'm guessing it's about 5:00 A.M. in the morning. Maybe because of hunting I slept so good yesterday. Also since night is early here, I got the needed hours to sleep. At night, there's not much you can do here. Unlike earth, this world has no T.V. nor games or entertainment. So I have no choice but to sleep. And candles is not cheap here.</p>

<p>However, I actually plan on waking up early from now on. Since I'm planning on getting muscles, I need to train everyday.</p>

<p>“Momo, I'm going outside. Can you stay here?”</p>

<p>Momo cutely wipes her eyes and began to stand up. So she's still same just like other kids. She started to walk lazily and she seems planning on going together with me. Training together is fine but I'll just leave her here when hunting.</p>

<p>Wait. I'm gonna travel soon. Is it fine to take Momo with me?</p>

<p>Why didn't I think about it. I randomly give her a name yesterday but taking a child on a travel is pretty dangerous. She's just gonna be burden.</p>

<p>Oh! right.</p>

<p>“Momo, can you disappear when a monster appeared?”</p>

<p>Since I can't take care of her everytime. I'm thinking she can just disappear everytime were in danger.</p>

<p>Since Momo can't speak, she nodded her head 3 times to confirm.</p>

<p>“Good girl, Momo.”</p>

<p>I patter her head and she's pretty happy when she's being praise. So we left outside the inn while she use her invincibility.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Little closer to the town. I stretch my body to lossen my muscles and bones. Since I'm not hunting right now, I'm not gonna swing sword or other stuff. Instead, I'm just gonna do physical training like running and push ups.</p>

<p>I was planning on taking in lightly but since Momo is here I got cocky and worn myself.</p>

<p>“Ha... Ha... Ha... I'm... So... weak...”</p>

<p>Even though were running intensely, Momo is not at least tired at all.</p>

<p>I'm so short on breath right now but Momo is still running happily.</p>

<p>“Isn't nice to be a child.”</p>

<p>Isn't I'm a child too?!</p>

<p>“Good morning, Akito.”</p>

<p>While taking break, as always Lidell gretted with his hottie smile.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Lidell. As always thanks for making party with me.”</p>

<p>“Same here. Let's earn a lot of money again today.”</p>

<p>“You're a noble right?”</p>

<p>Lidell is a person who relax when he has no opponent.</p>

<p>“Even though I'm noble, my father's rank is not that high and I'm fifth son, so it's even imposible to get engaged.”</p>

<p>Even though he's a noble there's still ranking from it. Like baron to duke, which is pretty same with earth.</p>

<p>If this guy is in earth, he'll surely get flooded by girls. But if were talking about engagement or in politics, the story will change.</p>

<p>Since he was the one who talk to me first, I thought <em>this guy will betray me.</em> And now that were friends already, I feel cringe about myself everytime I remember it.</p>

<p>“For me, I still prefer Love Marriage. Political Marriage is not independent after all. Since you have good face, you'll surely find someone effortlessly.”</p>

<p>If Lidell is in earth, he'll surely get a jackpot. I wonder if there is also in this world?</p>

<p>“I'll take the half for advice but nobles that didn't inherent is no different from commoners. However, even though they're not noble anymore, they still act like one. So it's hard for commoners to handle.”</p>

<p>“Being noble is kinda troublesome. So since you can't engage nor inherit, what will you do from now on?”</p>

<p>“I'll give up my inheritance and become independent. After that, I'll take the Knight Examination and become Kingdom's Knights.”</p>

<p>“Knight huh... As expected from you.”</p>

<p>As Lidell change his expression. I wonder, is becoming a knight is Lidell's dream or he just doesn't have choice but to do so. For me he looks like a prince but being knight seems he also looks good into.</p>

<p>“That's why I'm hunting monsters. Since there's no war in this era, killing demons and monster is most of the jobs of the knights.”</p>

<p>“So killing monster is part of your training, so that you'll be able to become knight.”</p>

<p>“Yup, but yesterday's battle is really my first time.”</p>

<p>I see, so the reason why he's good at hunting yesterday is because Lidell is training for his knighthood. Since Lidell is also noble, he was also educated and trained properly. And becoming adventurer is probably to gain more knowledge that is connected to his career.</p>

<p>Training, equipment and, gaining knowledge is normal for adventurers, so that they'll be able to take down a demons but the most moronic here is me. I can't believe I'm trying to hunt a demon with no preparation at all.</p>

<p>Wait, if Lysette just give up on her inheritance, wouldn't she will no longer get assassinate by her in-laws?</p>

<p>But in detailed. To be able to abandon your inheritance, there's gotta be another person who's higher than your rank or the next heir is applicable to the right on inheritance. Since Lysette brother-in-law is not adult, nor not higher than Lysette's rank, he doesn't have right to succeed the title.</p>

<p>While I was distracted, Momo suddenly look into my face. Oh, I forgot to introduce her to Lidell. But when I introduced Momo to Lidell, he apparently can't see her.</p>

<p>“As expected I can't see her.” As Lidell look at my side with his serious face.</p>

<p>Too bad.</p>

<p>“Is person who can see brownie is a rare case?”</p>

<p>“No, they are not really rare but in order to see brownie's, the person must have a spirit attribute. Since I can't see her, means I have no attribute on spirit magic.”</p>

<p>“I see... If others can't see her meaning I can relax leaving her alone without problem.”</p>

<p>“Yup. There's a lot of person who's gonna take advantage of you when they see you with her after all.”</p>

<p>Taking advantage of her ability, I asked Momo to be only seen by me, whenever were in outside.</p>

<p>“Since we have brownie today, how about hunting boar for today? Since boar makes more money than wolves we'll be able to get much more money than yesterday. Also, adding the ability of brownie's we don't have to lift the boars on our own.” (TL: Brownie's are like Magic Bag in this series.)</p>

<p>“You can't probably see her but please call her Momo. She's taken likin to that name, so we'll both be happy, if you call her by her name.”</p>

<p>“Oh, My bad. Welcome aboard, Momo.”</p>

<p>Momo who's sitting on my lap became very happy when she was greeted by Lidell.</p>

<p>“Let's go then.... Meat huh.... I would rather to eat than to sell it.”</p>

<p>“Then let's split it. It's not like were gonna sell it all.”</p>

<p>One Horned boar. Apparently one horned boar just like the same itself.... As it name, the boar has black colored body, red horn and, red glaring eyes. The size was about horse and about 100 kilograms in weight. It's much more bigger than I expected.</p>

<p>“The horn was his main weapon but attacking on the back is also dangerous since he can kick by using those legs.”</p>

<p>“Understood.”</p>

<p>Since the boar sense us, the boar readied himself and attack us, but Lidell who notice it, he use his shield and protected us from attack. Lidell's shield is just thin plated iron but he's still trying to hold it back, so that he'll not be blown away.</p>

<p>His forms looks simple and easy to do but taking that big ass boar face to face is not something I can do. I don't have courage to do it.</p>

<p>“..!”</p>

<p>Then Lidell use the timing of the force, dodge it, and use the side of the boar. Then Lidell repeatedly attack the feet and neck of the boar which is quite effective.</p>

<p>Using magic, I supported Lidell by firing magic bullet at the wound of the boar which helps Lidell to attack the other side of the boar then attack that wound with magic bullet again.</p>

<p>“Akito, were good now.”</p>

<p>Comparing to Lidell's speed, I'm slower. If the boar suddenly rush to me, I'm not confident I can dogde and attack it at the same time. Maybe I can dodge it by jumping but attacking it at same time, I'm scared.</p>

<p>That's why I'm relying on Lidell's strength. Looking at him, it looks he can defeat that boar by himself. Since I'm also observing the surrounding's, you can say that Lidell can fight without care about other monster. So, I'm little useful.</p>

<p>We fought the boar about 10 mins ago, since the boar is not moving anymore, I guess it's already dead because of blood lost. This is pretty tiring, I don't think I can hunt this boar everyday.</p>

<p>Basing on the size of the boar, this seems worth and effort.</p>

<p>“Let's just take this boar later on a butcher, it may cost a money but it'll take our time less.”</p>

<p>“Agree, Momo can you take care of this for me?”</p>

<p>As always Momo nodded happily while holdings a twigs she probably picked up somewhere. After that, a magic circle appeared under the dead boar and disappeared.</p>

<p>“After seeing it again, it's really a great power.”</p>

<p>“Hey, what about Momo? Reappearing that big boar will attract attention right?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but we can just take Momo in my house. It's our prey after all, we can just ask someone who will butcher it at my home.”</p>

<p>“That helps.”</p>

<p>“The best way to hide Momo is probably to take a Private Purchase. Since there are some items or weapons that an adventurers has, the guild will protect that information so that it will not cause rumors. Because of that, adventurers are willing take private purchase because there's no information leaked behind them. Protecting information is one of the guild's job, so they will not likely say a thing.”</p>

<p>For guild, adventurers is maybe there secret producer. No wonder they are scared since adventurers are scary.</p>

<p>“The worst is when you even have to gamble just to protect that information.”</p>

<p>After that, we hunt 4 more other animal then I hit my limit. So we gone back to the town without forcing myself.</p>

<p>Returning to Lidell's house we were able to sell pieces of meat for 50 copper coins, horn was 40 copper coins, magic stones were 30 copper coins since we kill 5 monster in total we got 150 copper coins, and the rest animals were sold by 30 copper coins. In total we got 750 copper coins, cutting it in half I got 375 copper coins this day.(TL: Momo is not included.)</p>

<p>At first day I got 35 copper coins, at second day 140 and now third day I got 375 copper coins.</p>

<p>“I can't believe on the progress of my net worth.”</p>

<p>“Normally when hunting one horned boar, you always need at least 5 people to  pull that thing out without cart. So if we hunt that boar with four or five people, we may not get that much profit, so let's just say it's all thanks to Momo.”</p>

<p>Even if we killed that boar, we may not likely be able to lift that thing off on our own. Because of Momo we were able to make thing efficient than hunting wolves. Well, there are parts that cannot be sell but it's safe to eat.</p>

<p>“Thanks for being here Momo!”</p>

<p>Apparently when I patting her head, she really likes. I guess I'll give her something delicious as her reward.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>The town of Grimoire spreads out on the east coast of the river. If you go upstream, there's mansions of nobles and expensive looking shops. While the downstream side is where commoners lives in and mostly commoners make business in there. And at the center of the town, there's another river, which seperates other houses that is also part of Grimoire town.</p>

<p>Me, I was staying at inn in commoner side. It was not cheap. The futon was not comfortable and it was run down inn but at least I'm safe.</p>

<p>As I drop my bag on the floor and pick the child clothes I bought. I was actually planning on buying the new one but it was expensive, so I buyed the old one's instead. Adding both the clothes and the bag it was 50 copper coins.</p>

<p>Although I bought the old one, the clothes I bought was pretty good on Momo. Since she was wearing one piece dress, I also bought the same one, with green ribbon on the back. Adding the pick color of the dress, which represents the peach. It was perfect match for Momo's plant-based appearance.</p>

<p>“Hey Momo. Thanks for the help, here's your reward. Come here.”</p>

<p>After that, I change Momo's clothes with the newly bought one. She became more cuter and she looks like little princess from another country.</p>

<p>“Wow! It looks like a dress only created for Momo.”</p>

<p>As she enjoy her new clothes, she excitedly jump left and right and run around the room.</p>

<p>Seeing Momo dance around the room, I feel like I wanted to protect her from any danger even just a insect. Right now, I feel like I'm fully grown parents. So this is what it feels like to be a parets huh.... Yahoo!</p>

<p>It's already been a week since I became adventurer. Ever since Lysette summoned me, I'm not worrying about my food anymore.</p>

<p>Since Lidell help me to write my letter, I paid 300 copper coins which is pretty expensive. I just want to tell on Lysette that I'm safe and stopped worrying about me.</p>

<p>But I'm still worried if that letter will ever reach Lysette. Since I don't know her address, I just randomly write Lizanan and her full name. Since Lidell says, nobles are pretty famous, it will reach her safely.</p>

<p>For the past 3 weeks, my daily routine was training in the morning, hunting with Lidell, wait for the payment, go back to my inn, and eat then sleep. It was kinda slow life series but I'm already used to it.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm about to go back on my room again. Surprisingly, my over all earnings was 3,500 copper coins for a whole week. Since I buyed necessary things like food, personal belongings, the replacement leather armor and, the letter.</p>

<p>My remaining money now here is 1,000 copper coins. I actually wanted to buy my own sword but it was expensive. So I decided to borrow Lidell's spare sword in the meantime.</p>

<p>“Even if I spend money on my equipment, I feel like I can still reach my 2,500 copper coins in a month.... Well, in the end it was all thanks to Momo and Lidell though.”</p>

<p>At first, I was just planning on going to Lizanan, but since this world is dangerous, I can't afford to go on a journey without knowing anything. And I also want to earn money while travelling. Because of that reasons, I need to get prepared on physically and financially. Haste is sometimes recklessness after all.</p>

<p>“I heard there's no magic nest around Lizanan, so it's probably safe in that town but since it's different city, the prices there might be higher than here. ”</p>

<p>“Then, I'll just stay put here for a while and get ready I guess.”</p>

<p>It's not like I want to become burden on Lysette after all, for a guy like me, that was lame.</p>

<p>But in exchange, Lidell is the one who's taking the burden. For now, I'm just gonna rely on him and pay him back someday.</p>

<p>“Like I said, you can just rely on me anytime. I'm also gaining from it after all.”</p>

<p>Good looking and also naturally kind to everyone. That's kind of person Lidell is. I also want to become like him. Both of appearance and body.</p>

<p>Good appearance and has good souls.... I'm not that kind of person. For now, I'm just gonna focus on my muscle training and in magic. With the power of muscle and sword style, adding a magic that has no interval, I can hunt any animals on my own.</p>

<p>Also, you can actually used the magic bullet in other parts of body. For example, eyes. Instead of using my fist, it's pretty much easier to aim when using my eyes, like an cyborg with a beam.</p>

<p>Another discovery is, you can actually used magic bullet directly to the target. Instead of using the usual magic bullet, you can just accumulate the magic bullet on someone and fire it. I tried it on rabbits but I can't do it. Doing it is pretty tiring but it's possible. Maybe I can't do it but someone here might can do it.</p>

<p>Since you can hit a magic without aiming, it might be dangerous, nobody will most likely able to dodge it. Since I can't find any countermeasure from it, I'm scared in teaching it to someone. (TL: It's like guided missile.)</p>

<p>For now I can fire 30 magic bullets. The power of that is enough to knocked out a wolf. But if I choose to kill it, the power needed will increase, so I can only fire 10 times. Well, knocking it down is probably enough, since I can just finished it by using sword.</p>

<p>For that reason, I change my target to wolf to one horned boar. I can actually kill a single wolf by myself but, there are times that they attack by pack. If ever a two or three wolves attack me, I might not win. Even if Lidell is at my side, I can't afford to take it easy since there's another wolf waiting.</p>

<p>Hunting with Lidell, we already assume that there are more than 2 or 3 opponent we might encounter.</p>

<p>But since our tactics are perfect, we can kill monsters without me or Lidell getting hurt. While Lidell use his body to protect, I can use magic bullet to knocked out a monster then we can just finished them off by swords.</p>

<p>“Since you're easy to rely, I feel like your spoiling me.”</p>

<p>We may be hunt a lot but there are times I need to hunt on my own to train myself. I can't afford for Lidell to always rely on after all. Sometimes I need to rely on myself like when Lysette summoned me here.</p>

<p>But hunting on my own still makes Lidell worried about me. Even though he's watching me hunting, he was like my guardian, watching my back if ever something bad happens. Of course I'm grateful to it.</p>

<p><em>Don't worry about me.... I want to say but I can't.</em></p>

<p>But I need to change my mind set. In my current state, I can't help Lidell at all. Even if he's beside on me, I'm not fast enough to protect him from other monster.</p>

<p>Even if I can beat monster on my own, once you get weaken, it's definitely hard to survive. That's the lesson I learn when I'm fight those wolves. I'm not like badass main characters on a novel or in a game. That's why, I'm gonna reflect myself to that.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I can actually beat One horned boar on my own. Since that boar only knows straight attack, I can just dodge and use strong enough magic bullet to knocked it. You can just say One horned boar are just muscle brain.</p>

<p>In short it's easier than wolves!</p>

<p>After knocking out the boar, I'll just wait for a few seconds, when he's not moving anymore, then finished it.</p>

<p>Since wolves are smart enough to dodge my magic bullet, they were pretty hard to aim. That's why I choose the less brain one horned boar as prey. At first, I'm dodging the first dash but when you put enough power on magic bullet, you can just aim for the head and it will knocked it. </p>

<p>As a result, the normal 100 copper coins normal income of adventurers exceeded their income which I get 500 copper coins a day. Well in the end it was all thanks to Lidell and Momo but most of it is probably because to Momo's cheat ability.</p>

<p>But it is the best when we're not getting injured at all. Ever since I fought the wolves, I slept for 2 whole days. In the end it was all thanks to Louise healing magic, because of it, it enhanced my body to heal faster. But if Louise don't have healing magic, I may not be here and sleeping in her room for a week or I might be dead now. In short, the best solution to get more income is not to get yourself hurt.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Another week past.</p>

<p>At first, I'm getting muscle pain everyday, but after a week, I'm not getting muscle pain anymore. In my current size, I may not get any muscle anymore.</p>

<p>“I'm looking pretty good now.” I praise myself.</p>

<p>As I continue to learn swing sword from Lidell, I can swing properly now unlike in the past. Since adding weight to sword adds more power, I always got hard time controlling the swing of the sword since it's heavy. Well, if I can used it as spear maybe I can used it to stab.</p>

<p>But thanks to the muscles and training, I was able to swing sword now without getting swayed by the weight of it. Because of that, I was able to discover some things.</p>

<p>Apparently you can tell the sharpness of that sword just by swinging it to the air. If you swing a sharp sword it will sound smoother while dull sword will sound dull. In short, sharp sword tends to sound quiet unlike dull swords. For now, I'm gonna practice how to swing quiet.</p>

<p>In the end it was hard. I'm lacking with ideas. Everytime I swing my sword, apparently my arms makes sounds instead. I guess I'll just focus thrusting instead.</p>

<p>As sweats rush over my body, a refreshingly handsome guy walks out to refresh my day. I want to be like him.</p>

<p>“You're always right on time.” I said.</p>

<p>“You're also here early like always.”</p>

<p>“You're always helping me out. I want to become considerate as much as I can.”</p>

<p>Before hunting, me and Lidell came to Adventurers guild to pick my new equipments. In the past week, I earned 4,000 copper coins, which helps me to buy one handed sword roughly cost 3,000 copper coins and bow and 20 arrows for hunting.</p>

<p>I may be pay a lot, but it's better since it's my own. I can also hunt even without Lidell after all.</p>

<p>My saving is around 1,600 copper coins. I can now plan when will I go to Province Lizanan.</p>

<p>It's already been 20 days since I came to this world and this past week we're pretty lucky. If I can save 2 or 3k copper coins as travel expenses, I can now say gratitude to the person who help me for the past weeks.</p>

<p>“That's the sword I lend to you right?” Lidell asked.</p>

<p>“Yup. I'm sure of it.”</p>

<p>Don't tell it's useless now since I used it wrong? Should I donate this new sword instead?</p>

<p>Then Lidell show unlikely face to the sword I borrow. Then he checked the grip and other parts and he gets his magic tools. Lastly he cast unknown spell to the sword then...</p>

<p>“Woah! That will be useful in the dark.” The sword glowed up.</p>

<p>Maybe I can use it to replace candles.</p>

<p>“This magic tools is used to light things. If this sword can amplify it, means this sword is Magic Sword. It's not created in mithril though.”</p>

<p>“Really?! I didn't notice it when I was borrowing it.”</p>

<p>The sword I buyed was only 3,000 copper coins. Lidell sword is pretty same with my sword in looks but Magic Swords might value more. I didn't expected I was using it though.</p>

<p>“No. I'm sure it was just normal sword.” Lidell said.</p>

<p>“I take a lot of time choosing my first sword, so I'm so sure that's the sword you lend to me.”</p>

<p>“Basing on the appearance, I'm sure this is my sword...”</p>

<p>“I've been using it everyday and I didn't notice it. I'm impressed you noticed.”</p>

<p>The main difference to me is the sword was kinda dull now than before. Maybe because they taking care of it in the past... I feel like there's something missing parts in that sword now...</p>

<p>“I'm relieved that the sword is not broked. For now, how about I'll take it to blacksmith? I feel bad making it that way so I want to give it back fixed. Of course I'll pay.”</p>

<p>At the next store, there's blacksmith, who fix sword and other stuff. Apparently the owner purposely open store here for efficiency. If ever a weapon cannot be fix anymore, he will buy it and sell it with high price next door. His business is lit.</p>

<p>Then I ask the blacksmith to see this Lidell's sword to me. Then the blacksmith check the sword again like we did.</p>

<p>“This sword is definitely have magic ore on it.”</p>

<p>Magic ore is a ore that is been exposed to mana. Comparing to ordinary ore, magic ore is much more stronger. It was one of the material used for magic swords, armors and other stuff.  As he talk about ore's, I discovered that there is different kinds of magic ore in this world. Then when I asked if one of them is mithril, apparently I got it right. As expected from a fantasy world.</p>

<p>If a ordinary iron ore is expose to mana. It will become much more stronger, less likely to rust and, sharpness will also improved.</p>

<p>“Mithril ore is also good. It can amplify more mana than average and it's light. It's probably best material for making armor and sword. The main concern of this ore is it's lightness. Unlike iron, which is heavier, it has more power than lighter mithril.”</p>

<p>According to the blacksmith, the best ore is called Orichalcum. Orichalcum is one of the mythical material used by heroes. Apparently they were only 5 confirmed orichalcum weapon and 2 orichalcum armor.</p>

<p>Rareness of a weapon can be divided into 7 parts.</p>
<li>Mythical Class.</li>
<li>Legendary Class.</li>
<li>Transcendental Unique Class.</li>
<li>Super Rare Class.</li>
<li>Advanced Class.</li>
<li>Intermediate Class.</li>
<li>Lower Class</li>

<p>And the sword we bought was lower class. As expected it was not like main character weapon. It only did the job to train me.</p>

<p>“This kind of weapon is not that big deal, you can even get this without travelling magic nest. I will buy it for 120 silver coins.” The blacksmith said.</p>

<p>That?! Not big deal? And you're buying it for 120 silver coins. As expected from magic swords.... it's expensive.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry but I cannot sell it. It was a gift to me, so I only want it to be fixed.”</p>

<p>Fixing the magic sword cost 300 copper coins. While mine can be fix for 100 copper coins. Since I'm already here also, I also bought whetstone and oil for anti rust.</p>

<p>Somehow, it cost me a lot of money but I already completed my items. Because of today's expenses, I have 1,300 copper coins left. By the next week, I can finally travel all the way Lizanan.</p>

<p>Since Lidell already know my objective, I guess I'll update him about my next week plan.</p>

<p>This past 2 weeks, Lidell really helped me a lot. Lidell is my friend who supported me both mentally and financially. Of course I want to pay him someday but it's not like those thing he needed. I'm talking about how he supportted me and help him as he did to me.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This noon we were supposed to hunt but since fixing the magic sword and buying things needed takes a lot of time, we cancelled it instead. In this past 2 week, all we do was to hunt and sell. So isn't bad to take break once in a while right?</p>

<p>So this time, I invited Lidell on a meal, of course with Momo too. We three, were already friends in this past 2 weeks but we all didn't get proper meal together. Even if we hunt, were just eating, easy to eat food, since cooking takes time.</p>

<p>So we go to a restaurant without our equipment. Apparently we can't enter if we have weapon on our things. And surprisingly, Lidell is fine with it.</p>

<p>“I hope this restaurant suit with your taste.”</p>

<p>“I'm not picky. If I'm not with my family, I want to act like commoner, so you don't have to care too much.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like you.”</p>

<p>Because of grammar, and body physique, Lidell can blend with them unlike other noble.</p>

<p>Since it's noon, they were a lot of people eating. So we wait a little bit. The restaurant was pretty noisy but it was not noisy to ruin our conversation.</p>

<p>Me and Lidell ordered meat while Momo choose vegetables. While eating we just continue our conversation.</p>

<p>“Akito, you want to go on Lizanan right? If you don't mind, can I ask why?”</p>

<p>I don't mine but I cannot say it all. Since Lidell is noble, maybe I might discover something from his reactions.</p>

<p>“Noble's taboo is black hair right? But you don't care my hair at all. But that's not the general response from aristocracy isn't?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately but yes.”</p>

<p>I see. So Lidell is not particularly friendly but he doesn't care about traditions.</p>

<p>“I have a friend.... She was a noble.... with a black hair.”</p>

<p>Lidell's reaction were convinced instead of disgust.</p>

<p>“Helping her seems recklessness you know.”</p>

<p>“She was once assassinated but it fail. So it's most likely recklessness.”</p>

<p>“Is she in danger?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. But I don't plan on taking those words lightly.”</p>

<p>Basing on my words, I'm impatient. But I have plan, and taking that plan is probably the safest.</p>

<p>Facing the window, I told thoughts to Lidell.</p>

<p>“If I could, I want to help her. But in reality, I'm the who's getting help. I'm always troubling everyone. So I really need to apologize to her for saying <em>saving her.</em>”</p>

<p>Louise, the guys from adventurers guild, Momo and  Lidell. All of them, they really help me for these past 2 weeks.</p>

<p>“I don't think you're trouble.” Lidell said as he also face the window. “Akito's presence has helped me a lot - including Momo, of course. Not in the beginning, but now I know that Akito is no less capable than I am of defeating our enemies.”</p>

<p>With those words, I felt a sense of security, as if I had obtained the minimum guarantee that I would be able to live on my own. I almost cried.</p>

<p>But I understand myself that I don't know many things. So I can't listen to him yet.</p>

<p>“I'm really grateful to you. Or more like I appreciated your help.”</p>

<p>However Lidell shows sign of confusion in my words. But thanks to him, we were able to defeat monster on our own. I can also defeat monster on my own but I can't ignore the risk part. In the past, I'm the dumbass guy who thinks I can defeat monster on my own without preparations but I'm confident now that I can defeat monster on my own.</p>

<p>“You want to become knight right? Why though?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No reason. It's just normal for us, who lost in inheritance to become knight.” As I changed the subject, Lidell gladly rode with it. “In my case, I thought that military officers were closer on protecting the civilians than civilian officers. I don't know who's better but in short it's just about who's closer to that point.”</p>

<p>Certainly, militaries were closer in protecting civilians. They fight directly after all.</p>

<p>“So it's Noblesse oblige.”</p>

<p>Duty of nobles. Lidell is not saying absurd things. In his point of view, fighting for others is natural thing.</p>

<p>“No, I'm not talking about that exaggerated thing but I've been feeding by civilians taxes, so in exchange for that I want to become sword and shield for the kingdom”</p>

<p>Both facing our face, I can see Lidell's blue eyes, but the inside was not me. It was distant goal but the path was narrower.</p>

<p>“If you have that loyalty to kingdom, it'll be waste if you didn't become one.”</p>

<p>“It was a narrow goal but I need to work to the bone to expect your expectations. I need both skill and achievement but with your cooperation, it will help me.”</p>

<p>“Cooperation is always my wish, so I hope that you can get along with me as much as time allows.”</p>

<p>“Of course. For the sake of my wish also.”</p>

<p>Being able to support each other is a wonderful thing. But in order to not left behind, I need to become greedy.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>As we finished our lunch, I gone back to my inn, sit on my bed and remember the past events.</p>

<p>Thanks to Lidell I was able to saved money. Apparently the average earnings of an adventurers were 3,000 coper coins. But I was able to earn 3 times of that because of 3 reasons.</p>

<p>First is magic. Since I was able to use magic, I can attack monsters within a distance. Magic bullet is also helpful because it can knocked out a monster with a single shot. And Lidell as my shield is also helpful.</p>

<p>They were pretty a lot of people here who can use magic but if you divide it in 3 parts, there is <em>Attack Magic</em>, <em>Healing Magic</em> and, <em>Everyday Life Magic</em>. Most people here can only used Everyday Life Magic. And the person who can only used Everyday Life were only called Magic users. While the person who can used more than Everyday Life Magic, were called Magicians. And a person who can used powerful Magic Attack's were called Advanced Magicians. Lastly, a person who can used magic without chant are called Mage.</p>

<p>In my case, you will probably think I'm mage. But for me, I'm not. I can used No-Incantation Magic but I don't think that's enough to classify me as Mage. It's a attack magic but the abilities of other magicians like in Advanced Magic will likely has more powerful magic than mine.</p>

<p>As Lysette teach me about magic. Attack magic are Spirit attributes. And that 6 Spirits were Light, Dark, Fire, Water, Wind and, Ground. In addition, if you activate a certain attack magic, the color of it will match the color of the spirit. Fire means Red, Dark means Black and other types of colors. However, my magic bullet is colorless. So we can say my magic bullet is not categorize as attack magic..... I don't hope so.</p>

<p><em>I'm starting to lose some IQ here...</em></p>

<p>In any case, I can used magic bullet. So I don't care if you call me a Magic user or a Mage, I don't really care. I'm not interested.</p>

<p>Second is because of Lidell's help. Since Lidell used his own body as shield I can attack on any enemies without getting hurt. Since his skill as hunting is promising, I can leave myself to him protecting me.</p>

<p>Adding his knowledge about hunting, since Lysette didn't teach me about it, Lidell and other's teach me a lot instead. They teach about how to choose a safe water, make a fire and in choosing a prey. All of this knowledge were because everyone in Adventurers guild teach me. I wonder how can I pay them back?</p>

<p><em>Because I meet Lidell, I was able to make things easier for me.</em></p>

<p>If I didn't meet Lidell, I'm just probably hunting rabbits right now.</p>

<p>Third and last is because of Momo. In hunting One horned boar, you always needed a lot of person in carrying that thing off. Because of Momo's existence, we were able to less the cost of labor and lessen the number of share. So we were able to hunt freely without carrying anything.</p>

<p>They were also magicians who specializes spatial magic. They can temporarily store things and take another things to prevent the loss of luggage. There are also magic tools called Magic Bags, that used spatial magic to work. This tool is quite expensive so people don't have it...</p>

<p>Comparing this 2 magics to the brownies, is far from different. It's the concept of time. Concept of time can pass through both of spatial users and magic bag. For example, when you put ice on magic bags or in spatial magic, the space is still connected to the time which cause it to melt. While the brownie's space doesn't connect to time, so if you put ice on a brownie's, it will not melt.</p>

<p>Since I'm leaving all the sales to Lidell, there might be other person who's gonna suspect how we able to get this kind of product untouch. Because of that, I decided to pretend I'm owning a magic bag. It can also be use to hide the existence of Momo. The bags have different kind of designs, so random pouch is probably enough to fool them.</p>

<p>“Do you need something, Momo?”</p>

<p>Right now, Momo is sitting in the bed. Everytime our eyes met, she always smile while tilting her head. I don't kow if my face is funny but she's so adorable, I can't help to pat her head. Apparently patting her head makes her sleepy.</p>

<p>Everytime we go outside, Momo is changing her clothes to the old one. I'm happy that she's taking care of it. Since I asked Momo to stay invincible everytime we go outside, wearing the clothes I bought, cause her to visible to others.</p>

<p>So in daytime, Momo wears her old clothes for invisibility, and wear the new one when were in the inn. Since she's taking care of it, I'll buy her again another clothes. I might find another clothes that she can stay invincible beside her old clothes.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Momo's old clothes were look like rag in appearance but it was actually antique beautiful dress. When I first met Momo, I thought it was rag but for some reason it became beautiful.</p>

<p>Apparently when you leave your clothes to Momo, she's doing some kind of cleaning or laundry effect that makes it clean. Laundry was pretty hassle but since Momo is doing it for me, it was helpful. Maybe she learn it when I take her to bath. In the end, Momo can clean herself and her clothes now. I don't know when she's doing it though.</p>

<p>“Thanks for always helping me, Momo.”</p>

<p>Momo can't speak words but you can tell by seeing how happy she is right now. Little by little I feel like I can understand now what makes Momo happy.</p>

<p>Another thing I discovered was, even though were eating the same food, Momo actually used the food to absorb magic from it. While I was meditating my mana, Momo suddenly hugs me and I felt that my magic is being absorb. Thankfully, I notice it coincidentally.</p>

<p>Since Momo can understand words. I ask her a few things. Firstly, Momo needs mana as nutrients. It's once in a while but if she wasn't supplied by mana, she will disappear in this world and will go back to the spirit world.</p>

<p>I don't know much about Momo but thanks to my fantasy knowledge, I was able solve it. Her looks might be first grade schooler but she's quiet. She's also listening to my teachings that lessen my worry of getting her hurt. To tell you the truth, my sister is more hassle than Momo.</p>

<p>Arriving here was really hard but thanks to these 3, I was able gain strength to live in this world.</p>

<p>Then, after using magic this far. I was able to create another magic. It will be difficult on putting it to actual battle but I'll try to shape the feeling of it until I go to Lizanan. If I can make it in time. I would like to teach this magic to Lidell someday.</p>

<p>While I was thinking about this, the candlelight is about to run out, indicating the time to go to sleep. Momo was also feeling lightheaded, so I picked her up and put her to bed, and I immediately fell asleep as well.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>The next day, as usual I trained and hunt with Lidell, of course with Momo.</p>

<p>“Everything seems to be alright.” Lidell said.</p>

<p>“Yeah. Thankfully, I choose the same sword.”</p>

<p>The sword I bought was not bad. The sword has general purpose but, even though I switched from Lidell's sword, I don't feel any discomfort.</p>

<p>So I tried using the sword with monster named Bad Cow. In general idea, the looks of this monster is like big buffalo, weight around 300 kilo's. Adding the weight and size, if you got hit by those horn, which is used as the main weapon, you'll definitely die.</p>

<p>So using defense is impossible. If you try to challenge the buffalo head to head, you'll likely get blown away. So targeting the feet is logical way to stop it's movement then finished it.</p>

<p>Using big rocks as shield, using trees as obstacle can be also used to lessen it's movement, then gradually lessen it's physical movement by using bow and arrow. Once it started to move slowly take advantage of the speed and slash it consecutively.</p>

<p>I started using bow so that I can save mana. Unlike other monster, Big Cow is fast enough to blast me in 5 meters range of magic bullet.</p>

<p>“Hey Lidell, that monster is targetting me!”</p>

<p>“Roger, I'll stop it's movement!”</p>

<p>This is the 4th Bad cow we hunted but, this dude too is also targeting me. All this time, Lidell used himself as bait but, for some reason this cow's always looking at me.</p>

<p>If you evade too quickly, the cow will predict it and change it's directory, so this guy's are pretty smart. So I need to endure the fear and wait until the last meter and dodge the cow's dash. Going back to the first cow, I evade the cow's dash quickly, so the cow change it's directory. Thankfully, I was able to dodge it in the second time. But the back of my leather armor got torn instead. That was bitter experience.</p>

<p>This world is not like those in the game I played. After all this world has no revival like in games. Immediately death. I wonder if there's resurrection magic, I'll ask Lidell later on.</p>

<p>After evading the last dash, I'm gonna stand immediately and wait for another dash. I can't evade+attack at the same time like Lidell after all.</p>

<p>“Akito, yours again!”</p>

<p>If Lidell is not being targeted, he normally can't evade+attack. In short, I have to stop it on my own.... Aren't this too hopeful to me!</p>

<p>“Momo, give me arrow!”</p>

<p>Them the sword in right hand disappear and was exchange with arrow. This is our main weapon of Me and Momo in this hunting so far.</p>

<p>I put the arrow on the shivering bow. The Bad Cow is now looking at me. The distance was 5 meters, it was the speed of the cow per second. So I need to unleash the arrow in a mili-second and roll over.</p>

<p>“..!”</p>

<p>I suppressed my fear my and unleashed the arrow.</p>

<p>The arrow hit the cow and falls of where I stand up, it was just beside of me. Fortunately I didn't get hit by it whatsoever. So I get away from it while Lidell thrust his sword down to the neck and the cow starts to flutter, splashing blood everywhere.</p>

<p>Sh*t, that was close.</p>

<p>Apparently the arrow didn't hit the head but it hit the right leg instead which cause the cow to fall over. I thought there's no way I can missed it but, If you're focus on surviving you'll lose concentration from it.</p>

<p>“Are you alright?” Lidell asked.</p>

<p>“I just got scratched from rolling. Thankfully you stabbed that ckw immediately.”</p>

<p>“It's still early but this is 4th already, this is enough.”</p>

<p>As he said. It was the same excuses everytime. Is it some kind of intuition im this world? Personally, I would like to see this through until the end but it's probably better to go with the flow. Retreat is not bad option after all.</p>

<p>“Yeah. I want to make tactics about that monster pattern.”</p>

<p>“I also have one too, it only workd on monster though.”</p>

<p>It seems like there's a magic that can attract or frustrate monster. Is it like provocation act like in games? I wonder if that will help to avoid the situation like earlier.</p>

<p>Well, if that monster makes Lidell nervous, I really need to think tactic to counter it.</p>

<p>“We're same, I'm still practicing it but I'm usre this will be useful in hunting.”</p>

<p>As the Bad cow disappear from Momo's magic, I replenish her magic by patting her head. Her cheeks loose like a slime that is been exposed to sun.</p>

<p>Is it around noon now? Apparently the day here is early. The sun rised around 5 o'clock and we start to hunt around 7 o'clock. So working 6-7 hours enough.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>While going back to the town, J decided to tell my plan for the nwxt week.</p>

<p>“Lidell, I'm starting to get a lan on going to Lizanan.”</p>

<p>“.... Yeah, it might take time travelling, so the early the better. Your armor and equipment seems durable too.”</p>

<p>Lidell think first before he answer.</p>

<p>I already heard that there's no Magic nest in Lizanan but there are some in the way. So if worst come first and I can't get magic stones, I'll hunt animals instead.</p>

<p>I started to think like this because Lidell teach me how to fight, so it's seems normal to me.</p>

<p>“I owe this all I have. If you didn't talked to me at that time, I might still chasing rabbits right now.”</p>

<p>“I guess but, you can kill wolves in no time now.”</p>

<p>“I hope so... Mentally I'll get mental breakdown soon on later on, if I continue that.”</p>

<p>“You're much more iron-willed to me though.”</p>

<p>Iron-willed? Arriving in this world, I feel like I became crybaby from then. That's the last word I don't want to hear from myself. But If Lidell sees my that way, I will just agree to him and hide my weak side.</p>

<p>“That's why I need to pay you something before I leave in this town.”</p>

<p>“Even if I say it's not necessary, you will probably not listen.“ Lidell said.</p>

<p>“It's something I can do, so don't expect too much, just wait and see.”</p>

<p>“Just don't forget you're helping me also.”</p>

<p>To tell you the truth, I don't have idea what's Lidell thinking. He seems more to be more reliable than I am. If something happens, he'll surely tell me. I'm sure of that.</p>

<p>Then when the sunlight passes through Lidell's hair, his blonde hair change into orange one. As the wind blows, his hair was gently shakes his hair, which makes me feel jealous. I hope he'll share some of his genes to me.</p>

<p>Arriving at the town, I parted with Lidell to do some training.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Right now, I'm in a place where I always train. It was grassland pretty far from the town. I feel embarrassed when other people sees me training so I choose a far and unnoticeable place to train.</p>

<p>Laying down as I think what I can do..
.. In my current swordsmanship, I can defeat One horned boar now. It was fast but it only knows 1 attack and that is straight dash. So defeating it was easier.</p>

<p>Unlike Lidell my swordsmanship was worst when compare to. I can't cut clean like him or more like it was shallow. Shallow cuts means lower damage, so I need to attack more which increase the risk of injury. Nevertheless, observing it improves both knowledge and physical endurance. So let's just take it as experience.</p>

<p>While in magic, I was teach by Lysette in the past but, I can't use any spirit magic yet. Learning spirit magic won't be sble to learn unless you got teach by other magician. And learning it needs magic tools, which I don't have money to spend. So the current magic that can be used were only magic bullet.</p>

<p>“Well, this magic is better than learning useless magic.”</p>

<p>Then I discovered that you can used magic bullet thinly, which improve penetration and sharper with longer distance. Current distance was 10 meters, the more distance, the power lessen.</p>

<p>So if you activated it in a large monster it will not do much damage but if you test it in rabbits, the damage is enough to cause concussion.</p>

<p>“Firee!” Then grass falls down at once, just like it's been agitated by a strong wind or where the magic was placed. If there's 2 or 3 animals lumped together, I can attack them at once. Even if I use this to strong monster, it can at least slow it down.</p>

<p>The closer the range, the better. If the range is more than three meters, it will be ineffective.</p>

<p>“It would be interesting to see how well it would repel attacks.”</p>

<p>I don't know how much impact it can endure but it can at least stop wolves attack. Since magic can only released mana in a millisecond, thr amount of magic consumed seems to be low. But if you try to put the magic continuously, the magic power will run out immediately.</p>

<p>“It would be a lot easier if I had unlimited magic, but I don't feel my magic increasing as much as I used to, even with all the magic I'm using.”</p>

<p>The feeling that it is increasing is much lower than in past, so I may be at the limit of mana growth is near. If the magic bullet itself uses a great deal of magic power, it's still difficult to become a magician if that's not the case.</p>

<p>“I'm not aiming on becoming a mage but, I still want to use magic.”</p>

<p>I mean, If I can't use magic anymore my future plan will fail. So I want to used magic as much as it needed. It at least increase my mana.</p>

<p>Experience has taught me that bigger, stronger, and advance magic you go, the more mana will get consume. Well, that makes some sense, but the upper limit of the amount of my magic power is low, meaning that the less conditions you meet, the limited the time you can fight.</p>

<p>In any case, this is what I can do now. And today, I'm going to try something new. I've been controlling the magic bullets in my own way, so I think it's possible to do it right away.</p>

<p>“My body is still same just like in the previous world right?”</p>

<p>I'll be in shock if the only same is the appearance. Well, let's assume that they are the same. If not, the story will not progress.</p>

<p>When a person's body receives an electric shock, it moves regardless of his or her will. I wondered if it would be possible to combine this with the principle of magic, which gathers and releases magic power from the entire body, to assist with physical abilities.</p>

<p>“Well, the quickest way is to actually try it.”</p>

<p>As I close my eyes as usual. First, start with the form. The first thing to do is to concentrate on the flow of magic power, blocking out unnecessary thoughts as much as possible. Feeling the same sensation as activation of magic bullet.... Normally, I would shoot the collected magic power, but this time, the magic power will reach your body. I squeeze it out of my body and use it to assist my muscles within my body.</p>

<p>I move my hands while feeling the magical power circulating in my body, and check the movement of my muscles as it fluctuates. At the same time, I feel the flow of magic power that accompanies the muscle movement, and try to realize it this time with magic power alone, without moving my hands.</p>

<p>“I feel itching somehow. ...... Whoa!”</p>

<p>After doing that for about an hour, I felt a sensation of movement, although I did not move. From there I continued for another 10 minutes or so, but there was no progress.</p>

<p>I changed my mind, and this time I intentionally moved my hand from the place where I felt the movement. Then I felt it move more lightly than usual. It is difficult to do everything with magic power, but it seems to be possible to use it as a supplement as I intended at first.</p>

<p>I got up and tried to control the flow of magic power while swinging the sword before I forgot what I was feeling. As I swing the sword with lightly, and it cut through the air more sharply than I before.</p>

<p>“Oh! It's more amazing than I thought it would be!”</p>

<p>I didn't think it would work this well, but if I could figure out the principle, it might be possible for anyone to do it. If this is original, I would be very rich from the patent fees. But, if it is basic knowledge, They're just gonna laugh at me teaching this proudly....</p>

<p>For now, I'll call it "Body Strengthen". It's a pretty good name. (TL: Yeah for you...)</p>

<p>After that, I continued to strengthen my body until I can use it to my whole body. Because of momentum, I moved around without thinking about mana usage, as a result, I almost lost consciousness due to a lack of mana. I cautioned myself for getting carried away, but the real lesson came the next day.</p>

<p>As I woke up as usual 5 A.M. I find myself in a state of severe muscle pain. I managed to woke up just like my daily routine but in the end I was unable to go hunting.</p>

<p>Liddell was aghast to see me like this, but I was sure he would suffer the same fate in time. I will try it out for a few days, and if it is safe to use, I will teach it to Liddell. This magic will surely useful to him.</p>
