<h3>■First Request Quest</h3>

<p>“Lysette....” I was dreaming.... I'm dreaming Lysette is calling me. Now I've waked up, I don't remember what it is anymore.</p>

<p>Perhaps because I had a concrete plan and my mind was relaxed, or perhaps because I had more time to spare in my daily life. Of course, it was not only Lysette who's I always think about, I'm also worried about my family in the previous world.</p>

<p>*I laugh.* Isn't this is just long vacation? Why am I getting homesick? Isn't I'm the one who want to live alone in highschool.</p>

<p>The unfamiliar ceiling will one day be replaced by a familiar ceiling, and the memory of the ceiling I saw in my room in the original world will fade away.</p>

<p>“...!?”</p>

<p>Now I'm getting scared, that I'm losing my previous self.</p>

<p>Suddenly something warm and soft was pressed against my cheek. Momo's relaxing scent and her soft breathing voice soothed my heart. Talking about something useful. In fact I feel doing something useful by just taking care of Momo. I feel hopeless for myself. Even if Lidell protect me, deep inside I still feel scared. That's why I'm fighting to become strong.</p>

<p><em>I'm scared but you still want to fight...?</em> Yeah I'm scared, but I need to do it! I promise to help Lysette after all.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>“Kid! You're prey is getting bigger and bigger! I'm impressed you can hunt Bad cow now.” Bearded guy said.</p>

<p>In order to save money, I go to Adventurers guild to sell this stuff. And as always bearded guy and other 4 were already drinking.... How happy they are.</p>

<p>“You're starting to get used here. How about making party with us? We have brute beast we're currently hunting and we're out of people.”</p>

<p>In the eyes of these people, I'm probably who's taking this thing off.... but it was actually Momo. Hunting with 2 person only will likely get attention of other person, so the best excuses here is neither spatial magic or magic bag. Even if they think about something rare about brownie, I can just use noble Lidell that has magic bag or something.</p>

<p>I've recently hunting One horned boar and Bad cow, so it's probably better to change opponent now as new experience...</p>

<p>“Is it fine?”</p>

<p>"Well... I want to you to carry out luggage for 4- no about 5 days.... So how about 1,200 copper coins."</p>

<p>In my current party, I can still earn more than that but, I need experience. I can't let the chance of experiencing battle of professionals. And Lidell probably wants that also.</p>

<p>“I'm in! I want to fight too! But I'm gonna ask for my partner's opinion first.”</p>

<p>“No, were the only one who's gonna fight. Take the blonde guy with you too, if possible.”</p>

<p>So I leave the town and go to Lidell's mansion. It was big but not in exaggerated way. Well~ my house was big enough to fit a few house.</p>

<p>Meeting the same gatekeeper. Wait for Lidell. After a while, Lidell showed up. It's not been long time after we finished hunting but he was wearing normal clothes with no armor. Even with this appearance, he's still hot.</p>

<p>Putting that aside, I ask for Lidell's opinion.</p>

<p>“This is good opportunity.” As Lidell looking for better experience. We accepted, bearded guy's offer.</p>

<p>As I said the confirmation, we need to prepare for tomorrow.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>The next.</p>

<p>It's still sunrise but I can see 2 large shadows and 3 normal looking shadows in the west. Apparently I'm the last. I adjust my schedule waking up earlier but I was still the last.</p>

<p>The large one was Bermund, aka Besrdguy. He's armed with one handed sword with large shield on his bag. I was expecting he was axe user basing on his physique but he is probably more skilled with one hand. Over the leather armor, he has mail armor. Basing on the shield, he seems to be a vanguard just like Lidell does.</p>

<p>The other big guy was Marcus. He is much lighter than Bermund but he seems more smarter. He is equiped with long spear same as his height and same leather and chail mail armor. These 2 big guy's seems our vanguard.</p>

<p>Next guy was Cloyd, a perfectly average guy with average height, built and, appearance. He is dressed with clothed clothing and robe. Basing the staff on his right hand, he seems to be a magician.</p>

<p>Next to him was, Nicholas a gentle looking guy with handsome looking face. He ks armed eith bow and arrow on his back and dagger on his waist and leather armor for easy movement.</p>

<p>Beside me was Liddell, carrying his usual gear and a light backpack.</p>

<p>Unlike the hunt day, we all gonna camping out of the woods, so I had a bit of baggage as well. Well, the contents are only portable food and water.</p>

<p>Following Lidell's advice, I prepare all the necessary items in journey rather than leaving all things to Momo. Just in case, I prepare random pouch if things get bad.</p>

<p>“Our journey is forested area before our neighbor village, Tomrina. We're gonna exterminate the besr monster in there. It was reported that it attacked trading party 2 times along the way. Monsters are ferocious by nature, but this one is even more. If you run into him, don't think you can escape, because he's even faster than he looks.”</p>

<p>This is the information we heard from Beard guy. Apparently it was a monster who moves frequently from another magic nest. Usually, monster's don't frequently moves when it's far, but this demon is different.</p>

<p>It's unknown why this monster keeps moving but it is quite difficult to stay alert for sudden movements.</p>

<p>And since this monster moves along to roads and village, it cause damage. So, the guild choose to make request to kill this as soon as possible.</p>

<p>That explains why Beaded guy's party wants to kill this monster.</p>

<p>“Ho??” I killed a boar suddenly came out of grass. “That's quite impressive from a boy like you.” As bearded guy said with impressed expression.</p>

<p>“You can count on me!” As I replied with big smile, I pulled the knife in my waist and began to skin the boar I killed. I wasn't very good at it at first, but after hunting for the past three weeks, I was able to skin the boar myself.</p>

<p>“But kid, why don't you have shield? It's not like you can't afford right?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I tried it once, but it was heavy. Maybe because I'm using my fingers to hold and it's hard to move.”</p>

<p>“Shields is not that useful, but if you familiarize how to used it, you'll be able to protect yourself.”</p>

<p>“Normally, I will just dodge it but If it's futile, I'll do this....”</p>

<p>Then I shot the Magic bullet on the tree. The impact adds shockwave which makes the leaves falls out. (TL: I really like when author don't forget that his mc was a kid. "Originality" I guess.</p>

<p>“Wh-what the was that?!”</p>

<p>“It's supposedly magic though.”</p>

<p>“When Akito can't evade, he will just use that magic, and it's surprising powerful to knocked out a monster. When I first saw it, I was also stunned but I'm already used to it.”</p>

<p>Lidell who's been watching my growth. Also got stunned. Well since I just did it randomly, these guy's also stunned by it.</p>

<p>“Cloyd, what kind of magic is this?”</p>

<p>Then Cloyd takes her time thinking then, “Most likely.... a failed magic.”</p>

<p>“Fail!” (TL: 失敗かよ！) <em>Shippai ka yo!</em></p>

<p>Then Marcus and Beard guy starts to laugh out loud.</p>

<p>“If only I studied how to properly use magic, I should have able to use it.”</p>

<p>I hate to say it's failure, but usually when magic fails to materialize, nothing will happens. But the magic itself is still lost. What happens to the lost magic power is that it dissipates. However, magic itself is power, so it is possible to make the magic power that is dissipating act as power, as it is now. Normally, if you can control magic power to that extent, it should be easier to materialize some kind of attribute magic. So no magician would use it as just a shockwave."</p>
