<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>It all started when I found this magic stone. A magical stone that can transcends other world.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆</p>

<p> I will be a freshman in high school after this spring break, and I use the last time after school to say goodbye to my classmates, whom I will meet less and less.</p>

<p>As usual when I&apos;m alone I always take unusual side trips and after that going home later than usual.</p>

<p> But for some reason I feel lacking and something irritating that even myself can&apos;t understand. In order to control those feelings, I distracted myself into video games and novels, that surprisingly I got hooked into.</p>

<p> I have strict but righteous parents, a twin brother and sister that I can expose my feelings to without hesitation, a wealthy family filled with the things I needed. I myself had good grades, popular enough with the ladies, and could do most things as I wished. That&apos;s why, I think I&apos;m more fortunate than others around me.</p>

<p> And yet, I always craved for something. It&apos;s something difficult to say, but there was always something that could not be satisfied, not family, things, or money.</p>

<p>Something that I want was filled by the world of games and novels.</p>

<p> And then, I somehow understood.</p>

<p> That, I was craving to be desired for my existence. I know I&apos;m not a chuunibyou, but if that&apos;s the case, I have no choice but to accept it. Then, let&apos;s admit it from the beginning. I want to be the hero of a story.</p>
